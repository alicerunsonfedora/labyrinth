**Labyrinth** is a small Lua library aimed to bolster the standard
libraries in Lua with a focus on game development.

Currently, Labyrinth offers the following out of the box:

- Additional functions for working with collections via tables.
- Additional facilities for working with strings.
- A built-in logger with controls for custom outputs and levels.
- Basic facilities for working with vectors and points.

## Getting started

Add the `labyrinth` directory to where you store libraries in your Lua
project.

> **Note**  
> For those using this library with a Playdate game, you will need to
> add [pd-require](https://github.com/DimitriBarronmore/pd-require)
> and import it into your `main.lua` file.
